They prefer to remain in the shadows and attack from behind or in many cases not attack at all, preferring instead to use the chaos of battle as a distraction while they acquire gear and money, or just eliminate enemies in a more civilized fashion. The ROGUE class breaks down into three primary ability groups consisting of the BURGLAR, the SURVIVOR, and the ASSASSIN.",
