# RPG Game Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the key development milestones and feature sets needed to complete the open-world RPG game. The game includes various core mechanics such as inventory management, skill trees, NPCs, quests, enemies, and character progression. Each phase of development will focus on specific areas of the game to ensure a comprehensive experience for the player.

## Phase 1: Core Mechanics

### 1.1. Character Creation
- **Files**: `characterCreation.js`, `characterSprite.js`
- Implement character creation, allowing players to customize their avatar.
- Develop sprites or allow dynamic changes based on character traits (e.g., skills, equipment).

### 1.2. Inventory System
- **Files**: `inventory.js`, `randomitems.js`, `chest.js`
- Establish the inventory system for item storage, management, and use.
- Implement chest interaction and randomized item generation.

### 1.3. Skill Tree
- **Files**: `skilltree.js`, `traits.js`
- Create a skill tree system that allows players to unlock new abilities based on progression.
- Ensure skill progression is tied to traits and stats.

### 1.4. Quests and Objectives
- **Files**: `questLog.js`, `updatedisplays.js`
- Implement a quest system, complete with tracking objectives and rewards.
- Set up basic quest structures to test how players progress through the narrative.

## Phase 2: World Building and Interaction

### 2.1. World Map and Spawn Zones
- **Files**: `spawnzone.js`, `teleport.js`
- Define spawn zones for player and NPCs.
- Implement teleportation points for quick travel and zone transitions.

### 2.2. NPC Interactions
- **Files**: `npc.js`, `tooltips.js`
- Build out NPC behaviors and interactions with the player (e.g., dialog, trade).
- Use tooltips for providing information on NPCs, items, and interactive elements.

### 2.3. Bestiary and Enemies
- **Files**: `bestiary.js`, `enemies.js`, `hostilequadrupeds.js`, `neutralanimals.js`
- Populate the world with different enemy types (hostile and neutral).
- Develop a bestiary system to log enemy types and stats as they are encountered.

## Phase 3: Enhancing the Player Experience

### 3.1. Combat System
- **Files**: `main.js`, `bestiary.js`
- Create a basic combat system where players can engage with enemies.
- Balance combat mechanics with skills and inventory usage.

### 3.2. Settlement Interaction and Structures
- **Files**: `settlement.js`, `purplestructure.js`
- Develop interactive structures within the world (e.g., settlements, buildings).
- Allow players to interact with the environment, such as trading and resting.

### 3.3. UI and Display
- **Files**: `ui.js`, `rodstyles.css`, `updatedisplays.js`
- Refine the user interface for inventory, quests, skill trees, and combat.
- Ensure smooth transitions and clear display of information.

## Phase 4: Final Polishing and Expansion

### 4.1. Testing and Debugging
- Thoroughly test all mechanics (combat, inventory, skills) to ensure balance.
- Debug all interactive elements to ensure there are no game-breaking bugs.

### 4.2. Expanding World Content
- Add additional quests, enemies, and NPC interactions to enrich the game world.
- Introduce more complex structures, environmental hazards, and hidden items.

### 4.3. Admin and Cheat Functions
- **Files**: `admin.js`
- Create a backend/admin toolset to allow for testing or setting up new game instances.
- Implement cheat commands for developers to speed up testing.

## Future Considerations
- Multiplayer functionality (if desired).
- Dynamic weather systems or day-night cycles.
- Additional character classes or abilities to enhance replayability.
- Storyline and narrative expansion through new regions, quests, and factions.
